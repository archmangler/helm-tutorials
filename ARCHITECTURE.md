# Architecture Considerations

## Pros and Cons of using Helm
*Pros*

* Helm provides advanced features like hooks and release management and simplifies complex Kubernetes deployments, reducing errors and ensuring consistency. It increases the speed of deployments.
* Helm has a large collection of pre-built charts that can be easily shared and reused. It also has pre-built charts for popular applications.
* Helm charts promote code reuse and version control for applications.
* Helmâ€™s release-centric approach facilitates easy upgrades, rollbacks, and uninstallation, essential for error recovery.
* Facilitates DevOps practices and concurrent deployments.
* It helps us streamline our CI/CD pipelines.

*Cons*

* Helm has complex templating and it needs to be set up separately.
* Helm is not well-suited to projects where a single container needs to be deployed on a server.
* Over-reliance on community components.
* Helm introduces a learning curve, especially for users new to Kubernetes.
* A project with multiple microservices, each with its dependencies, might encounter challenges when coordinating versions and ensuring compatibility across the entire stack.

*Top 8 Helm Charts Best Practices*

* Break down your charts into smaller, reusable modules for easier management and increased flexibility.
* Always version your Helm charts to track changes, enable easy rollbacks, and maintain a clear release history.
* We should increment the version and appVersion each time we make changes to the application.
* Use lowercase for the chart name and field name in values.yaml file.
* Always provide clear and concise documentation within your charts to ensure maintainable Helm charts.
* Name the Kubernetes manifest files after the Kind of object i.e. deployment.yaml, service.yaml, etc.
* Use Helm linting tools to catch issues early.
* Use the Helm community to leverage existing charts.
